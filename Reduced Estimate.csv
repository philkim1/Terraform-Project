"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.",,,,,,,,,

Rationale,,,,,,,,,
The only service that could be changed that would have a big enough impact on the budget is the EC2 service.,,,,,,,,,
"Instead of trying to change the tenancy or instance type, I opted to change the pricing strategy to standard reserve for 1 year.",,,,,,,,,
"Although we would lose the flexibility of on-demand, I believe with standard reserve we would be able to handle most of the traffic most of the time.",,,,,,,,,
