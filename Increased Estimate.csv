"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.",,,,,,,,,

Rationale,,,,,,,,,
"With double the budget, I decided to add redundancy by adding 4 more EC2 instances, so that there would be backup servers for both AZ's.",,,,,,,,,
The performance of the instances was increased from m5.12xlarge to m5a.16xlarge and the pricing strategy was changed to on-demand from standard reserve,,,,,,,,,
"With these changes we can handle peak traffic at any time, even if both sets of servers are down and with extra performance just in case.",,,,,,,,,
