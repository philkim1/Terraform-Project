"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.",,,,,,,,,

Rationale,,,,,,,,,
"With double the budget, I decided to add redundancy by adding 2 more EC2 instances, so that there would be a backup application and web server.",,,,,,,,,
The performance of the instances was increased from m5.12xlarge to m5.16xlarge and the pricing strategy was changed to on-demand from standard reserve,,,,,,,,,
"With these changes we can handle peak traffic at any time, even if one set of servers are down and with extra performance just in case.",,,,,,,,,
